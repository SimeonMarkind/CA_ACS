# CA_ACS
Analysis of America Community Survey Data 2010-2014 for the state of California.

I use raw ACS data from the Census to look at the income gap in California and analyze how it is impacted by factors such as gender, race, and education status.

Additionally I use shape files to create heat maps of CA and sub-regions of the state analyzing gender differentiation and concentration, racial concentration, and other factors.
